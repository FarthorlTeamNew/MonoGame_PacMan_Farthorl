- Improved pathfinding with increased difficulty
- make a factory class for the fruit
- add automatic level change
- create abstract class for ghost, with different colours (maybe different abilities)
- maybe add a game menu to select different skins for the ghosts (add all kind of interesting skins - spongebob, some kind of animals
- implement the logging of errors
- better structured classes, and classes organized in appropriate folders

Implement enum wherever possible, and use Parse/TryParse instead of simple strings
Use reflections to get all the fruit classes and create their instances without using any strings
